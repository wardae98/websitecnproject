                <h1 class="story-title">Fariy Tale 1: The Pied Piper of Hamelin</h1>
                <p class="story-info">In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicolored ("pied") clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. 
                    He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. 
                    The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him for the removal of the rats.
                    The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where they all drowned. But the mayor refused to pay him the fulll amount for his work, so the piper took revenge by playing a tune on his pipe that attracted 130 of the town's children. 
                    They followed him into a cave and were never seen or heard from again.</p>

                <h1 class="story-title">Fairy Tale 2: Rapunzel</h1>
                <p class="story-info">Rapunzel, the only child of a lonely couple who'd spent years wishing for a child, was kidnapped by an evil witch at the age of 12 and locked in a tower.
                    Some time later, a prince who frequently came to the tower to hear Rapunzel sing, asked her to let her hair down and let him in and they fell in love. They hatched a plan to escape right under the witch's nose using small lengths of silk that the prince would give Rapunzel each day.
                    But the witch caught wind of their plan and cut off Rapunzel's hair, casting her out into the wilderness to fend for herself. The witch then used the hair to lure the prince into the tower to kill him, but he jumped out to escape, landing on a thorn bush that both saves his life and also leaves him blind.
                    Years later, he hears Rapunzel's singing voice as he wanders the wilderness and they reunite to live happily ever after.
