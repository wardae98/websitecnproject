                <h1 class="bio-name">Jacob Ludwig and Wilhem Karl Grimm</h1>
                <p class="bio-text">The brothers Grimm were born in Hanau, just east of Frankfurt, Germany â€“ over the space of fourteen months. Jacob Ludwig Carl arrived on 4th January 1785, and was followed by Wilhelm Carl on 24th February 1786.<br><br>
                    In 1808, Jacob was appointed court librarian to the King of Westphalia. Shortly afterwards, both he and Wilhelm became librarians in Kassel. Under the direction of their patron, the German Romantic Clemens Brentano, the brothers began to scour the Kassel archives for ancient folk-tales. They also began to invite storytellers to their home, where they would transcribe their stories. They published their first book "Children and Household Tales" in 1812 and so marked the beginning of The Brothers Grimm and the fairy tales we know and love today.</p>
